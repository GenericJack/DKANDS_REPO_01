# DKANDS_REPO_01
This repo will hold the necessary files for a simple board game 

```Criteria
As a game player I want to create a fun new board game that will captivate my attention and spark others to play too.
The game will have a certain amount of randomness and a certain amount of strategy that will be PvP 1:1 
```


```md
GIVEN that I have a game to engineer
